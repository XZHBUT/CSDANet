# CSDANet

In engineering practice, small-sample fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment towards heavy noise interference poses great challenges for the existing intelligent models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new lightweight model called CSDANet. Firstly, based on Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), an efficient attention neural operator is innovatively designed by introducing multi-level convolution and layer scaling strategies. This design not only facilitates spatial interactions between local and global in vibration signals but also significantly enhances the perceptual capability of the attention module towards features. Secondly, a feature channel with long-term memory capability is designed to counteract the adverse effects of information loss, and this channel allows the model to preserve and extract richer feature information. Finally, a vibration signal feature extractor is proposed to obtain different scale feature mappings from the original one-dimensional vibration sensor signals. The results of two experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach accommodates advantages of lightweight and robustness in small-sample fault diagnosis tasks, compared to the existing mainstream Transformer and CNN fault diagnosis frameworks.
